📌 **Next Step** — You should create a `gameplay.gif` showing your game in action.  
We can do that easily by screen recording a short gameplay session, then adding it to an `assets/` folder in your repo.  

Do you want me to show you **how to record gameplay and make it into a GIF** for this README? That’ll make your GitHub page look amazing.
